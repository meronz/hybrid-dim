# Hybrid dim

This theme is based on the [vim-hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid) colorscheme by w0ng. I created a very low-contrast theme to help when coding for long hours. This theme obiviously reflects my personal taste, but feel free to contribute with variations and/or language specific improvements.

Enjoy ðŸ‘½
